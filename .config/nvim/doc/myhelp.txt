HELP                                                                *myhelp-help*

Type `:help` in command mode to access the help of `help` command

Sometimes you want to know what a particular control key means to Vim. For
example, to see all help topics containing `ctrl-r`, type `:h ctrl-r` then press
`<c-D>`

`K` Run a program to lookup the word under the cursor (normal mode)

`g<c-g>` show some statistics of the current buffer (normal mode)


================================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                        *myhelp-mappings*

If you want to check the mapped keys:

`:map`        List all mappings done via `:map`, `:nmap`, `:cmap`, etc.

`:help index` List all default mappings

Typically, `:map` will span several pages. You can use the following commands
to redirect the output to a file:
>
  :redir! > /tmp/map.txt
  :map
  :map!
  :redir END
<


================================================================================
SETTINGS                                                        *myhelp-settings*

Turn boolean settings off by adding a `no` as a prefix.
Example: `set noexpandtab`

Toggle your settings in vim by adding a `!` as a suffix.
Example: `set expandtab!`

Check a setting in vim by adding a `?` as a suffix.
Example: `set expandtab?`

Set numerical values with an `=n` suffix.
Example: `set tabstop=8`


================================================================================

  - `i` to enter terminal mode
  - `<c-\><c-n>` to exit terminal mode


================================================================================
DEBUGGING VIM ISSUES                                *myhelp-debugging-vim-issues*

`:messages`             View previously given messages. This is especially
                      useful when messages have been overwritten or truncated.

`:echo errmsg`          Prints the most recent error message.

`g<`                    The "g<" command can be used to see the last page of
                      previous command output. This is especially useful if you
                      accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter prompt.

`:checkhealth`          Run all healthchecks.

`:checkhealth` {plugins}
                      Run healthcheck(s) for one or more plugins. E.g. to run
                      only the standard Nvim healthcheck:
                        `:checkhealth nvim`
                      To run the healthchecks for the "foo" and "bar" plugins
                      (assuming these plugins are on your 'runtimepath' and
                      they have implemented health#foo#check() and
                      health#bar#check(), respectively):
                        `:checkhealth foo bar`

`$ vim -V[N][file]`     Open vim in verbose mode and save logs to `[file]`
                      Example:
                        `$ vim -V9/tmp/myvim.log`

`$ vim --noplugin`      Open vim loading vimrc file but disabling plugins

`$ vim -u NONE`         Open vim disabling vimrc file and plugins

`$ vim -R`              Open vim in readonly mode

`$ tail -f ~/.cache/nvim/lsp.log`
                        For LSP related issues
